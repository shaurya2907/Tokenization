# Tokenization
An ERC20 Metro token system developed on top of the Ethereum Blockchain.
Includes a KYC Authentication in which the deployer can whitelist the addresses that are allowed to buy tokens.
Users can buy tokens using a Web3 provider like Metamask and can see their token balance on the website.
The Smart contracts have been written in Solidity and are deployed on the Ropsten test network using Infura.
The backend is developed using truffle, node.js,javascript.
Web3.js is used to connect ot the blockchain and access the smart contracts.
A simple front-end is developed using React.js and HTML.
